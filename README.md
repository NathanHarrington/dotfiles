Nathan Harrington environment configuration resources


### System configuration instructions
<pre>
Based on stock Fedora Core 33 workstation MATE-compiz install.
  Why MATE? out of the box screen locking and suspend that is
  closest to regular Gnome. 

The procedure below expects the entire drive to be dedicated to the
fedora install, with the 'auto' partitioning setup.

On MATE-live system boot to the desktop:
Start the graphical install.
System -> Installation Destination
	Check the 'encrypt my data' box, set a passphrase.

Network -> set the hostname.

Create User -> set password, and check 'Make administrator'

Accept all defaults, after the install has complete, reboot the system.

Clone this dotfiles repository
git clone https://github.com/NathanHarrington/dotfiles ~/projects/dotfiles

hostnamectl set-hostname "short computer hostname, like u430"

    Install rpmfusion libraries (dnf install command for adding repos)

    dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
    dnf update -y
    (about 20 minutes later...)
    reboot

</pre>

Control Center -> Keyboard shortcuts, manually set:
run a terminal  Ctrl+Alt+T
Switch to workspace N  Alt-N  (for workspaces 1-4)
Add custom shortcuts for the rest of the workspaces:
	switch to workspace 5   wmctrl -s 4  alt-5
	switch to workspace 6   wmctrl -s 5  alt-6
	switch to workspace 7   wmctrl -s 6  alt-7

# Basic development environment
dnf -y install make automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel cmake
dnf -y install git autossh tmux
dnf -y install redhat-rpm-config python-devel

dnf -y install bat ripgrep

start parcellite,
Activate the parcellite config interface by pressing ctrl+alt+p
If you can't see the preferences pop up, it may be because you are operating on wayland and not xorg.

In parcellite config: 
    check "Use Copy" and "Use Primary", then click synchronize clipboards

### tmux configuration:

dnf install xclip urlview

Setup tmux with the instructions from http://tony.github.io/tmux-config/:

git clone https://github.com/tony/tmux-config.git ~/.tmux
ln -s ~/.tmux/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
cd ~/.tmux
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd ~/.tmux/vendor/tmux-mem-cpu-load
cmake .
sudo make install

cd ~
tmux 
( press control + a then d to exit)
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf

### Tmux auto-session startups

# Install tmux plugin manager
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm

Copy the custom tmux configuration:
cd ~/projects/dotfiles
cp custom.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf

 Create mate keyboard shortcut for Alt+F3 with:
    gmrun
  cp .gmrunrc ~/.gmrunrc

### Install nomachine

Download nomachine from: https://www.nomachine.com/download/linux&id=1 

run:

dnf install ./nomachine

If you get a message about an selinux failure with systemd read from
nxserver.service as described here: https://www.nomachine.com/TR11N07360

vi /etc/selinux/config

change 'enforcing' to 'permissive'

reinstall nomachine

### Move over previous system files. 

More recent versions of fedora allow you to connect the disk and it will
ask for a passphrase and mount your old encrypted home directory
automatically. If that doesn't work or you need access to the root
partition, try the process at the end of this file.

Copy the auto_backup folder from the old system:
cp -ra old_system_mount_location/home/nharrington/Documents/auto_backup ~/Documents/auto_backup

Make links from the encrypted folder location to the ~ location:
cd ~
ln -s ~/Documents/auto_backup/home.config_files/.ssh
ln -s ~/Documents/auto_backup/home.config_files/.gnupg

cd ~/.config/
ln -s ~/Documents/auto_backup/home.config_files/cmus
(You may have to re-add all the mp3s to the playlist)

cd ~/.config/
mkdir rclone
cd rclone
ln -s ~/Documents/auto_backup/home.config_files/rclone.conf

### Setup the rclone backup option:

Download and install rclone according to: http://rclone.org/install/

Verify rclone config is setup by type rclone config and looking at the remotes.

After the .gnupg directory copy as described above, and with a fully verified key
management and recovery system:

Anything you put in the folder below will be auto-backed up to the
cloud, with encryption
mkdir ~/Documents/auto_backup/

Add the following to crontab -e:

# Nightly tar backup build and upload
SCRIPTS=/home/nharrington/projects/dotfiles/backup_scripts
BACKUP_PREFIX=nh  (change this to the correct prefix! )
13 * * * * $SCRIPTS/encrypt_directory.sh >>$SCRIPTS/backup.log 2>&1
44 * * * * $SCRIPTS/rclone_hourly >>$SCRIPTS/backup.log 2>&1

# Email a summary of the backup directories for hand verification
MAIL_DEST="username@domain.com"  (change this to the correct email!)
29 3 * * * $SCRIPTS/mail_summary >>$SCRIPTS/backup.log 2>&1


### rclone backup sends verification emails as well, so configure ssmtp:

These are based on: http://crashmag.net/setting-up-ssmtp-with-gmail

dnf -y install ssmtp mailx

Update the ssmtp.conf file as shown below, where domain is a
"google apps for business" hosted domain, such as mybusiness.com

vi /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf

root=username@domain
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
RewriteDomain=domain
UseTLS=YES
UseSTARTTLS=YES
AuthUser=username@domain
AuthPass=<app password created from google)

alternatives --config mta
(select sendmail.ssmtp)

# Issue this command as root and primary userid
echo "username@domain" > ~/.forward

Test mail configuration:

echo "Test mail to root" | mail -s "Test root essmtp" root
echo "Test mail to local" | mail -s "Test local" nharrington
echo "Test mail to gmail" | mail -s "Test gmail" username@domain

Now that the backup script is in place and the email is in place,
temporarily change the crontab times to verify everything backs up
correctly.


### Sound specific configurations
    
See the notes in sound_control/README.md for details on how to
configure a Bose QuietControl 30 headset with bluetooth, and for using
cmus.
       
### Mate Terminal configuration

Set colorscheme green on black.
Turn off scrollbar.
Turn off show menubar by default.
Palette - choose xterm.

### Vim configuration
   
Install SpaceVim!
Start vim, wait, choose 2 dark powered mode.
Exit vim, restart vim. Wait for PluginManager to complete.
Following configuration instructions in: spacevimrc

### Keynav configuration

Clone the repository: https://github.com/NathanHarrington/keynav
Create a new branch for this OS if required, or use a previous branch.
Install preqequisits, make.
Copy the keynav desktop file to autostart:
cp keynav.desktop ~/.config/autostart/

### Pulse mixer
cd projects/
git clone https://github.com/GeorgeFilipkin/pulsemixer

### MATE Config
Right click the top menu bar, add 'select workspace switcher' panel.
Right click bottom panel, select delete panel, confirm.
Right click to panel, set to bottom, height 20.
Right click background, choose that first option that looks like a
picture but is a gradient, set to solid black color.

Remove everything but folders from desktop:
dconf-editor
Click Â org -> mate -> caja -> desktop 
Un-check all trash, volumes icons, etc. on desktop.
Appearance -> BlackMATE
As root, replace the lock screen bitmap with your desired image in:
/usr/share/backgrounds/default.png

To apparently prevent lockups when alt-tab switching, go to Control
Center-> Windows, and check 'Disable thumbnails in alt-tab'
      
</pre>

### Auto-keyboard configurations

    See the notes in autokeyboard/*.sh
    for details on commonly used keyboard automation scripts and how
    they should be bound in MATE.

### Recovering from backup:

    Restoring from old system encrypted home folder:

    Plug in the old disk run:
    pvscan

    You should see something like the same volume group names listed below.
    ACTIVE /dev/fedora/home    <- this is the current operating system
    inactive /dev/fedora/home  <- this is your old disk

    Run:
    vgdisplay

    Get the VG UUID of the older disk

    Rename the volume group of the older disk:
    vgrename OLD_DISK_UUID  oldFedora

    Unplug the disk, replug.
    Mount by device name:

    mkdir /media/DISK/home
    mount /dev/oldFedora/home /media/DISK/home

    Now if you do:
    ls -la /media/DISK/home/nharrington
    You should see blinking red failures to show you need to load the encryption

    The simple mode for read only access should be the command below. Make sure to run this
    in a root shell session. It will not work with sudo!

    ecryptfs-recover-private /media/DISK/home/.ecryptfs/nharrington/.Private
    Recover directory: yes
    Do you know your login passphrase: yes
    Enter your fedora gnome login password
